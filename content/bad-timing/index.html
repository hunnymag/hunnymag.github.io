            <p>I kept the watch you said
                <br>I could try on
                <br>the one with the wide face
                <br>glassy-eyed stare,
                <br>a full moon balancing
                <br>on my wrist
                <br>three hands flickering,
                <br>breathlessly marking
                <br>the twitching seconds</p>
            <p>I didn’t give back
                <br>that watch
                <br>at the time
                <br>I didn’t know we were
                <br>running late,
                <br>white rabbit speed</p>
            <p>counting the seconds you didn’t
                <br>pay attention
                <br>dizzy driving
                <br>with deli sandwiches
                <br>florist with all the lilies
                <br>running so fast that it hurt
                <br>in the morning
                <br>you
                <br>off in Europe
                <br>summer damp with early nostalgia
                <br>birthdays always come too soon</p>
            <p>after June you couldn’t
                <br>wear a watch anyway
                <br>not with the broken
                <br>wrist
                <br>watching
                <br>you wearing that
                <br>cast around town
                <br>a plaster reminder to lug on your rich-boy-tour-of-Europe trip
                <br>I wanted you the whole time
                <br>you put a hole in the wall
                <br>a hole gaping so wide it couldn’t decide
                <br>whether it was laughing
                <br>or crying</p>
            <p>did you really find yourself
                <br>in that Prague street?
                <br>or hurling
                <br>in that Berlin drain?
                <br>or in that grey apartment?</p>
            <p>I thought I found you in the crowd of people at the dim theatre
                <br>I thought I found you
                <br>when I wore that collarbone-white strapless dress
                <br>I thought I found you
                <br>when you said I’m the most beautiful
                <br>I thought I found you
                <br>when you raised that chipped glass of cheap wine
                <br>I thought I found you
                <br>when we said hello on the porch
                <br>I thought I found you
                <br>at the golf course
                <br>where Harry brought me first
                <br>you hated him
                <br>I loved that
                <br>I hate that
                <br>I loved that</p>
            <p>I used to watch you
                <br>I wanted that watch
                <br>I wanted to sync up with you
                <br>I was the second thought that you
                <br>never gave</p>
            <p>in December
                <br>the watch broke
                <br>leather band split
                <br>but in my desk drawer
                <br>the watch sprawls
                <br>crown face down
                <br>the hands still
                <br>nervously twitching
                <br>like they’re still trying to get things
                <br>straight</p>
