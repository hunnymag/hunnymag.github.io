            <p>Just FYI: this was maybe the hardest thing we’ve ever had to do. What you should take away from this list is that <em>Bob's Burgers</em> is a wonderful TV show, filled with wonderful characters who grow and age with grace, and magical, hysterical dialogue about important things like choosing between two boys at the school dance and toilets that can talk to you. It's <em>very</em> important, and we mean that. It took us quite some time to boil it down from all the episodes from all six seasons to ten episodes. There's a mix of episodes that center around each character from our favorite family, there's a couple musical episodes, and they're all a tremendous joy. (This list comes in no particular order, because the strain of that decision would probably kill us).</p>
            <ol id="bobs-burgers">
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Topsy"<br>Louise / Musical<br>S3E16</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Let’s start with the big guns. This one is top-to-bottom amazing, and if the song "Electric Love" was available on iTunes, I would own it. Louise attempts to expose her Thomas Edison-loving substitute science teacher by giving a musical presentation about the time he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy in public. *How controversial*</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Megan Mullally, Kevin Kline, and Billy Eichner</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">"You son of a snitch. What’s your favorite movie? Squeal Magnolias?"<br>"War Horse"</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Broadcast Wagstaff School News"<br>Tina<br>S3E12</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Tina! Poop! <em>JOURNALISM!!!!</em> Tina finds her Professional Woman side and her ideal camera angle investigating a student who’s been pooping around school and in dioramas about the Industrial Revolution. Truly Pulitzer-winning content.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Will Forte, Jenny Slate</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">"There's a lot of crowning stuff that can just be taped over. It looks like an angry softball trying to get out of a coin purse."</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Boyz 4 Now"<br>Louise / Musical<br>S3E21</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Oh BOYZ is this episode good. Louise experiences something new. Gene gets into competitive tablescaping. Honestly, I shouldn’t say anything more.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Max Greenfield, Jack McBrayer, Tig Notaro</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">“My heart just pooped its pants.”</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Christmas in the Car"<br>Whole Fam<br>S4E08</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">The title of the episode is pretty descriptive, but look out for Dutch Babies and Life and Death Situations. It’s heartwarming and perfect for the holidays (or right now, in June).</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Bobcat Goldthwait</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">“I have a ham in the oven.”<br>“It’s okay, dad. Just fart.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Bob Day Afternoon"<br>Bob<br>S2E02</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">~Crime is afoot!!!~ The family makes a lifelong friend, Jimmy Pesto gets humiliated on live TV, and Bob almost dies. It’s a bit of a whirlwind.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Kevin Kline, Bill Hader, Gary Cole</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">“Come back safe, Bobby. Don’t leave me with these friggin kids.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"The Equestranauts"<br>Bob<br>S4E17</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">This is a true classic. Bob goes undercover to recover (a horse doll that a rude man stole from Tina). It’s a true father-daughter bonding story.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Kurt Braunohler, Paul F. Tompkins, Ron Funches, David Herman</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Seaplane!"<br>Linda<br>S4E03</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Linda flies a plane! The whole family comes very close to death! Men are creepy! And tan! A true tale of survival, with a little bit of wine.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Will Forte</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">"Are you seeing how tan this guy is?"<br>"That's all I'm seeing."</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"God Rest Ye Gentle-Mannequins"<br>Whole Fam<br>S3E09</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Bob is bequeathed a storage unit from his dead Uncle Ernie. And what they find in there is not the riches of a former department store owner. I’m not sure if I can say it’s the exact opposite of that, but it’s pretty close. But, on the bright side, true love prevails and the Christmas spirit lives on (even in June).</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Zach Galifianakis</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"Two for Tina"<br>Tina<br>S3E17</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Tina really has it all in this episode. And she’s gotta learn to juggle the affections of two boys. Both are dancers, both are cute, both have butts. How will she ever choose? You have to watch to find out. (It’s a dance-off).</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Ben Schwartz</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph list-quote">“I dance Ballet.”<br>“Oh, a bad boy.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-heading">"O.T. The Outside Toilet"<br>Gene/Kids<br>S3E13</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph">Gene befriends a toilet, and an scary man tries to break them apart. The kids try and save the day, the adults get very drunk. It’s a blast.</p>
                    <p class="list-paragraph"><span>Featuring:</span> Jon Hamm, Neil Flynn</p>
