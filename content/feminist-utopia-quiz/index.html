            <h2>Feminist Utopia Quiz</h2>
            <h3 class="centered-title"><span>by Julia Azarcon</span></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>If you’re at all familiar with second-wave feminism, one of its most salient features includes the rise of feminist science fiction. Many of the works in this subgenre have been highly influential across several schools of thought, including gender inequality, sexuality, race, and reproduction. These themes are often illustrated through utopias, depicting societies where all the heinous transgressions of our patriarchal society have either been solved or never existed to begin with. However, many female authors have taken different approaches to reaching their so-called "utopia." Among some of the most notable texts of this period, which of these utopias do you fit into best? Are you ready to annihilate the concept of gender, or believe that radical separatism is our only hope? Transport yourself hundreds of years into the future and take this quiz to find out if you’re ready for the utopia that awaits!</p>
            <p>(This quiz was inspired by my English 368/Gender Studies 361 class called <em>Utopian and Dystopian Sci-Fi in Second Wave Feminism</em>. It’s offered in the winter and is an amazing class!!! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to read good books. It’s also one of my favorite classes ever, and that’s coming from a graduating senior. Special thanks to Professor Thompson who teaches the course, as she helped me formulate the questions!)</p>
